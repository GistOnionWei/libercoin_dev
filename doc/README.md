Libercoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Libercoin Core is the original Libercoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Libercoin transactions (which is currently more than 100 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Libercoin Core, visit [libercoincore.org](https://libercoincore.org/en/releases/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Libercoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/libercoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/libercoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run libercoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Libercoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Libercoin-Core.
